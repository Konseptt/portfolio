      I had the pleasure of working with Ranjan Sharma for three years at college, 
      collaborating on several project teams .
      I'm was always in awe of Ranjan Sharma ability to command a room and always so passionate with his work. Ranjan Sharma would be an asset to any team.`

      He is creative, smart, has excellent communication skills, and is willing to help when you need it. He is the kind of person who does anything for the groupâ€™s benefit. A great colleague!`
